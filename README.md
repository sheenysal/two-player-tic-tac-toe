# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. Players take turns to place their mark ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid, and the first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.

## How It Works

- Players alternate turns.
- The grid is displayed as a numbered list (1-9) where the players choose a number to place their mark.
- The game checks if either player has won after every move.
- If the grid is full and no one wins, the game ends in a tie.
